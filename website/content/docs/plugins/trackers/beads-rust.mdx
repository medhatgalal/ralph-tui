## Beads-Rust Tracker

The Beads-Rust tracker integrates with **[beads-rust](https://github.com/your-org/beads-rust)**, a high-performance Rust rewrite of the Beads issue tracker. It offers the same features as Beads with improved performance and SQLite-based storage.

<Callout type="tip">
Beads-Rust (`br`) is a drop-in replacement for Beads (`bd`) with better performance. If you're starting fresh, consider using Beads-Rust.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Install the Beads-Rust CLI (`br`) from the **[beads-rust releases](https://github.com/your-org/beads-rust/releases)**.

Initialize Beads in your project:

```bash
cd your-project
br init
```

This creates a `.beads/` directory with your issue tracker (SQLite database + JSONL export).

## Basic Usage

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** By default, Ralph TUI only shows issues with the `ralph` label. Either add this label to your issues, or change the label filter during setup (leave blank to see all issues).
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Epic">
    Epics group related tasks. Add the `ralph` label so Ralph TUI can see it:

    ```bash
    br create --title "User Authentication" --type epic --labels ralph
    # Created: ralph-tui-abc123
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Tasks as Children of the Epic">
    Tasks must be **children** of the epic (using `--parent`) to appear when running with `--epic`. Also add the `ralph` label:

    ```bash
    br create --title "Login form" --type task --parent ralph-tui-abc123 --labels ralph
    br create --title "Auth API" --type task --parent ralph-tui-abc123 --labels ralph
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
    The `--parent` flag creates a parent-child relationship. Without it, tasks won't appear when filtering by epic.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Dependencies (Optional)">
    If tasks depend on each other, add dependencies so Ralph works on them in the right order:

    ```bash
    # Login form depends on Auth API being done first
    br dep add ralph-tui-login ralph-tui-api
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Ralph TUI">
    Run with the epic ID:

    ```bash
    ralph-tui run --tracker beads-rust --epic ralph-tui-abc123
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

### CLI Flags

Run with epic and tracker:

```bash
ralph-tui run --tracker beads-rust --epic ralph-tui-abc123
```

### Config File

Set defaults in TOML:

```toml
# .ralph-tui/config.toml
tracker = "beads-rust"

[trackerOptions]
beadsDir = ".beads"
labels = "ralph"
```

### Options Reference

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `beadsDir` | string | `.beads` | Path to .beads directory |
| `epicId` | string | - | Epic ID to filter tasks (set via `--epic` flag) |
| `labels` | string | `ralph` | Comma-separated label filter (issues must have these labels) |
| `workingDir` | string | `.` | Working directory for br commands |

<Callout type="info">
The `epicId` should be set via `--epic` flag rather than config, since you'll likely work on different epics.
</Callout>

## PRD Context Injection

<Callout type="tip">
**New in Beads-Rust:** When an epic has a PRD reference, the PRD content is automatically injected into the agent's context for better task understanding.
</Callout>

Link a PRD to your epic using `--external-ref`:

```bash
br create --type epic \
  --title "Authentication Feature" \
  --external-ref "prd:./docs/auth-prd.md" \
  --labels ralph
```

When working on tasks under this epic, Ralph TUI will:
1. Read the PRD file
2. Include it in the agent's context
3. Show progress (completed vs total tasks)

## Beads Concepts

### Epics

Epics are top-level containers for related work:

```bash
# Create an epic
br create --title "Feature: Dark Mode" --type epic

# List epics
br list --type epic
```

### Tasks

Tasks are individual work items, optionally under an epic:

```bash
# Create standalone task
br create --title "Fix login bug" --type task

# Create task under epic
br create --title "Add toggle switch" --type task --parent ralph-tui-xyz
```

### Dependencies

Tasks can depend on (be blocked by) other tasks:

```bash
# Add dependency: task-b depends on task-a
br dep add ralph-tui-task-b ralph-tui-task-a

# View dependencies
br show ralph-tui-task-b
```

### Statuses

| Beads Status | Ralph TUI Status | Description |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| `open` | `open` | Ready to work |
| `in_progress` | `in_progress` | Currently being worked on |
| `closed` | `completed` | Finished |
| `cancelled` | `cancelled` | Won't do |

### Priorities

Beads uses 0-4 priority scale (0 = critical):

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 0 | Critical |
| 1 | High |
| 2 | Medium (default) |
| 3 | Low |
| 4 | Backlog |

## Task Selection

The Beads-Rust tracker selects the next task by:

1. Filter to tasks under the specified epic
2. Filter to tasks with status `open`
3. Filter to tasks with no unresolved dependencies
4. Sort by priority (lowest number first)
5. Return the first matching task

## Git Sync

Beads-Rust stores issues in SQLite and exports to JSONL for git tracking:

```bash
# Export to JSONL for git
br sync --flush-only

# Commit the JSONL
git add .beads/
git commit -m "Update issues"
```

Ralph TUI calls `br sync` automatically when completing tasks.

## Creating Tasks from PRDs

Use the `ralph-tui-create-beads-rust` skill (via Claude Code):

```bash
# In Claude Code
/ralph-tui-create-beads-rust
```

This converts a PRD into:
- An epic with PRD reference (`--external-ref prd:./path/to/prd.md`)
- Child tasks for each user story
- Dependencies between tasks

## Beads-Rust vs Beads (Go)

| Feature | Beads (`bd`) | Beads-Rust (`br`) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Performance | Good | Better (Rust) |
| Storage | JSONL only | SQLite + JSONL |
| Daemon mode | Yes | No (direct mode) |
| PRD injection | No | Yes |
| Plugin name | `beads` | `beads-rust` |
| Command | `bd` | `br` |

<Callout type="info">
If you have both `bd` and `br` installed, use `--tracker beads` for bd or `--tracker beads-rust` for br.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### "br binary not available"

Install the Beads-Rust CLI from the **[beads-rust releases](https://github.com/your-org/beads-rust/releases)**.

### "Beads directory not found"

Initialize Beads in your project:

```bash
br init
```

### "No tasks available"

Check that:
1. **Tasks have the `ralph` label**: `br list --label ralph`
2. **Tasks are children of the epic**: `br list --parent <epic>`
3. **Tasks are `open` status**: `br list --status open`
4. **Dependencies are met**: `br show <task-id>`

### "Tasks not syncing"

Export to JSONL manually:

```bash
br sync --flush-only
```
